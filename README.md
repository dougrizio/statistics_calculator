# Task breakdown

The starting point will be the orignal Calculator. This will be extended to create the Statistics class object.
    
* Create statistics methods
    * get_mean
        * get_mean method takes a sample data and return the mean
        * formula : _sum of terms / number of terms_
        * usage: get_mean(data) 
        * sample result:
        
        ![mean](/images/mean.PNG)  
        
    * get_median 
       * get_median method takes a sample data set and returns the median
       * formula: 
       * data is ordered
       * for an odd amount of values it is the middle value
       * For a data set with an even amount of values it is the average of the middle tow numbers
       * usage: get_median(data)
       * sample result:
       
        ![median](/images/median.PNG) 
        
    * get_mode
        * get_mode calculates the mode of a data set
        * the mode is the value that appears most often in a given data set
        * usage: get_mode(data)
        * sample result: 
        
        ![mode](/images/mode.PNG) 
        
    * get_variance
        * get_variance calculates the average of the squared differences from the mean of a set
        * calculate the mean of the set
        * calculate the difference between the mean and each number in the set
        * create a list of differences
        * square each difference
        * create a list of squares
        * calculate the mean of those squares
        * sample result:
        
        ![variance](/images/variance.PNG) 
        
    * get_standard_deviation
        * get_variance calculates the amount of variation in a set of values relative to the mean
        * calculate the variance of the set
        * calculate the square root of the variance
        * sample result:
        
        ![standard_deviation](/images/stan_dev.PNG) 
        
    * get_zscore
        * get_zscore calculates the number of standard deviations by which the value of the raw score is above or below the mean value of what is being measured
        * declare the raw score of the set
        * calculate the mean of the set
        * calculate the standard deviation of the set
        * subtract the mean from the raw score
        * divide the standard deviation from the quotient
        * sample result:
        
        ![zscore](/images/zscores.PNG)
        
    * get_simple sample
       * get_simple_sample takes a data set and the amount of choices needed as input
       * it calls the simple_sample utility static method
         * This in turn calls the n_items_no_seed from the RandomGenerators.py module
            THis can be called with or with out a seed value
       * usage: get_sample(data, number_of_choices)
            * example uses a sample data set with 3 choices requested      
       * The returned value is a pseudo-random selection based on the number of choices provided           
       
       ![simple_sample](/images/simple_sample.PNG)
       
    * get_confidence_interval
      * requets the confidence interval for a given data set
        * This assumes the standard deviation is known or calcualted
        * T_score or Z_score is known or calculated.
        * usage: get_confidence_interval(data)
        * sample results assumes a confidence score of .95
        
      ![confidence interval](/images/confidence_interval.PNG)
      
* Create random generator static utility methods
    * RandomGenerators.py
        * random_seed 
            * create a random number based on parameters
                * seed value - can generate a value with wor without a seed
                * decimal - determines whether generated number should be an integer or a float.
                * start - starting value range
                * stop - ending value range
                * step - the interval between numbers 
            * usage: random_seed(seed = None, decimal = 1, start = 0, stop = 100, step = 1)
                * generates a float value with no seed with a range of 0-99
