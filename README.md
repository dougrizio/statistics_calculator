		* Result
	* Methods 
	    * get_mean
	        * calls mean static method
	    * get_median
	        * calls median static method
	    * get_mode
	        * calls mode static method

    The starting point will be the orignal Calculator. This will be extended to create the Statistics class object.
    
* Create statistics methods
    * get_mean
        * get_mean method takes a sample data and return the mean
        * formula : _sum of terms / number of terms_
        * usage: get_mean(data) 
        * sample result:
        
        ![mean](/images/mean.PNG)  
    * get_median 
       * get_median method takes a sample data set and returns the median
       * formula: 
       * data is ordered
       * for an odd amount of values it is the middle value
       * For a data set with an even amount of values it is the average of the middle tow numbers
       * usage get_median(data)
       * sample result:
       
       ![median](/images/median.PNG)
